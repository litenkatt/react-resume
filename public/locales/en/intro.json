    "Welcome to my digital resume built in React.js!",
    "My name is Ninni and I  am a developer with a couple of years of experience. I have some backend experience in the form of java but most of it consists of frontend work. I work best in an environment with a lot of collaboration where everyone in the team has a chance to be heard. As for front- or backend, it makes no big difference for me. I have always been more interested in the technical parts of frontend work and I am a big fan of Javascript/Typescript.",
    "My dream is to work with something that makes a real difference in the world. That combined with my interest in health is the reason for which I am now taking a course in eHealth in my freetime.",
    "P.S. You can change both language and theme up in the right corner"
