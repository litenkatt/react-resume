    "Hello and welcome to my digital resume. I built this page just as much to show what I can actually do as to use as an actual resume. It is definitely unnecessarily complicated, just to have an excuse to use different techniques.",
    "I am a developer with mostly React experience, currently looking for a new job. During my current unemployment period, I've finally finished my bachelor, played around with Node and build this site. I feel like there is still work to do on this site but it is currently paused to work on AWS certified developer. I really love Javascript and would prefer a job that includes it and preferrably some cloud as well. ",
