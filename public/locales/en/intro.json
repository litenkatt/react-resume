    "Hello and welcome to my digital resume. I built this page partly to show what I can do, but also to use as an actual resume.",
    "Like so many others, I lost my job due to the corona virus and am therefore looking for new opportunities. During this period, among other things, I have been working on a course with the goal of passing the “AWS certified developer” exam. My previous experience is mostly React.js, the method used for building this page, but also some Java.",
    "Right now, almost everything is of interest but my long time goal is to work on something that has a real positive impact on the world. I am a big fan of Javascript, especially React but the most important thing for me is that the daily work feels meaningful and having colleagues I get along with.",
    "P.S. You can change both language and theme up in the right corner"
